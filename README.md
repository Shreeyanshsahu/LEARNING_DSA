# 📚 DSA with C++ and Python

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** learning repository!  
Here, I document my journey of mastering DSA using both **C++** and **Python**, covering everything from basic concepts to advanced problem-solving.

---

## 🚀 Goals
- Build a strong foundation in DSA concepts.
- Practice implementing algorithms in **both** C++ and Python.
- Prepare for competitive programming and technical interviews.
- Keep a well-organized record of my progress.

If you want, I can also **add badges, GitHub stats, and a visual roadmap** so the repo looks like a polished portfolio project.  
That will make it stand out to recruiters later.  

Do you want me to make that upgraded version?
